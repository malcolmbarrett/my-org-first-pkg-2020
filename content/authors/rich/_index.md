Rich is a software engineer that enjoys working with R. He likes to create R packages that help people to accomplish things. While Rich very clearly digs R, he enjoys other things as well! Examples include: playing and listening to music, reading books, watching films, meeting up with friends, and wandering through the many valleys and ravines of the Greater Toronto Area.
