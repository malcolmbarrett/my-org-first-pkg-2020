This is the website for the My Organization's First R Package Workshop.

This workshop will be offered January 27-28, just before [rstudio::conf 2020](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) in San Francisco, CA. This workshop will teach you how to develop an R package using modern tools and how to leverage the R package structure to streamline your organization's data connections, R Markdown reports, functions, and more.
