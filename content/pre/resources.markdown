We don't expect you to have experience developing R packages (whether internal or on CRAN), but if you'd like to explore some resources prior to the workshop, here are a few we recommend.

- [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/), the ultimate introduction to making R Packages.
- [Also keep an eye on the upcoming second edition](https://r-pkgs.org/). You may be particularly interested the second chapter, [The Whole Game](https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html), a guided tour of creating a package from scratch. The second edition introduces newer packages like usethis.
- [Resource Round-Up: R in Industry Edition](https://emilyriederer.netlify.com/post/resource-roundup-r-in-industry-edition/) by [Emily Riederer](https://emilyriederer.netlify.com), an excellent review of internal R packages. (Make sure to check out Emily's talk on R Markdown workflows during the conference!)
