In this workshop, we will use R and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). RStudio is not required but recommended. It makes package development very easy, and we will show many keyboard shortcuts and other tricks using RStudio.

## Install R

* A [recent version of R](https://cran.rstudio.com/) (>= 3.6.1 "Action of the Toes") is recommended. You can check your version from the R Console:


```r
getRversion()
```

```
## [1] '3.6.1'
```


## Install RStudio

* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) (>= 1.2.5033)  is recommended.


## Upgrading your system
