## Work in the :cloud:

For this option, you will:

- **Work** in a pre-configured, web-based RStudio IDE instance provided by [RStudio Cloud](http://rstudio.cloud)

## Why would I choose this option?

You just want this course to work without worrying about preparation on your local computer. You may not have time to do all the [local setup](../local), or you may not wish to modify your local install to upgrade right now. 

## What do I need to do before the workshop?

Not much! We will provide a link to the pre-configured RStudio Cloud workspace. You will need to:

- bring a laptop with the ability to access the internet, and
- bring your laptop charger.

## Will I be able to build any R packages I create?

Yes! All the tools for R package development will be at your disposal, including building packages that can be used.

## Will I be able to save my work?

Absolutely! You can export any files you work on during the workshop out of RStudio Cloud and save them locally on your computer.
