To get the most out of this workshop, we will typically work within [RStudio Projects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects) (`.Rproj`) and encourage you to use Git (via GitHub using RStudio) for version control. You can use RStudio as the Git GUI, so there is no need to install a separate GUI unless you have your own favorite. If you would like to use GitHub during the workshop, please follow the steps below from the online book [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/):

## Installation

1. [Register a GitHub account](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html)
1. [Install Git](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) 
1. [Introduce yourself to Git](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html)

## Connect Git, GitHub, RStudio

1. [Connect to GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/push-pull-github.html)
1. Do one of the following:
    - [Cache credentials for HTTPS](https://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html)

## Test-drive

We encourage you to follow a ["New project, GitHub first" workflow](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html). This means that if you want to work locally, you'll want to be comfortable doing the following steps:

1. [Make a repo on GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html#make-a-repo-on-github-1)
1. [Make a new RStudio project via git clone](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html#new-rstudio-project-via-git-clone)
1. [Make local changes, save, commit](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html#make-local-changes-save-commit-1)
1. [Push your local changes to GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html#push-your-local-changes-to-github)
